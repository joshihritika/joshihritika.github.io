              Born and raised in Kyoto, I've always been inspired by the perfect
              balance of tradition and innovation that defines Japanese culture.
              This harmony between old and new influences my approach to design
              and development.

              After completing my studies in Computer Science at Tokyo
              University, I worked with several technology firms in Japan before
              relocating to expand my horizons. I specialize in creating digital
              experiences that blend functionality with the aesthetic principles
              of Japanese design: simplicity, attention to detail, and
              thoughtful use of space.

              When I'm not coding, you might find me practicing calligraphy,
              tending to my small garden, or exploring local tea houses. I
              believe that these traditional practices inform my digital work,
              bringing a sense of mindfulness and craftsmanship to everything I
              create.
