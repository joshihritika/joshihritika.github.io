The 2024 IIAG shows that overall governance scores flatlined from 2019 and then ground to a halt in 2022, as rising conflicts, insecurity, and democratic backsliding eroded gains in economic opportunity and human development. About half of Africa’s population now lives in a country doing worse on governance in 2023 than in 2014. However, the continental average masks divergence: 13 countries (e.g. Côte d’Ivoire, Seychelles, Gambia) accelerated improvements – some of them among the world’s most improved – while 11 countries (including top performers like Mauritius and Botswana) saw worrying declines in rule of law, participation, and security since 2014.

Notes that standard development projects shy away from fragile contexts due to political risks and complexity, which leaves these countries furthest behind. The blog suggests investing in core government functions (like justice, anti-corruption) even when success is uncertain, piloting adaptive programs that can work amid instability, and using crises as opportunities to push reforms.
